# Baseline Permissions Manifest

> **Purpose:** Core system permissions for foundational business operations  
> **Domain:** Cross-cutting (Security + Core Domains)  
> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Status:** Reference Implementation  
> **Date:** 2026-01-13

This manifest defines the **initial set of business-risk operations** requiring permission controls. Domain services should register their specific permissions following this pattern.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Domain Services

1. **Copy the relevant section** for your domain
2. **Customize permissions** based on your specific operations
3. **Add to `permissions.yaml`** in your service's resources
4. **Register on startup** using the Permission Registry API

### Example: Registering Permissions

```java
@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class PermissionRegistrationInitializer {
    private final RestTemplate restTemplate;
    private final ResourceLoader resourceLoader;
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void registerPermissions() throws IOException {
        Resource resource = resourceLoader.getResource("classpath:permissions.yaml");
        PermissionRegistrationRequest request = 
            new Yaml().load(resource.getInputStream());
        
        restTemplate.postForEntity(
            "http://security-service/api/permissions/register",
            request,
            PermissionRegistrationResponse.class
        );
    }
}
```

---

## Permission Naming Rules

All permissions must follow: `domain:resource:action`

### Rules

1. **Lowercase only** - No uppercase characters
2. **Singular nouns** - Use singular form for resources
3. **Clear action verbs** - view, create, edit, delete, approve, cancel, etc.
4. **Alphanumeric + underscore** - Only use `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_`

### Valid Examples

✅ `financial:refund:approve`  
✅ `inventory:adjustment:create`  
✅ `security:role:assign`  
✅ `workexec:time_entry:edit`

### Invalid Examples

❌ `Financial:Refund:Approve` - Contains uppercase  
❌ `financial-refund-approve` - Wrong separator  
❌ `financial:approve` - Missing resource  
❌ `financial:refunds:approve` - Plural noun

---

## Risk Levels

Permissions are categorized by business risk:

| Risk Level | Description | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **LOW** | Read-only, no financial impact | View operations |
| **MEDIUM** | Write operations, moderate impact | Create, edit operations |
| **HIGH** | Operations affecting money or audit | Approve, void, override |
| **CRITICAL** | Highest-risk operations | Role assignment, break-glass, large financial |

Risk levels inform:
- Audit log retention (critical = 7 years)
- Alert thresholds
- Policy engine constraints
