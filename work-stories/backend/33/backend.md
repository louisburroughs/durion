## Story Intent

**As an** Inventory Manager,
**I want to** receive parts from a supplier shipment and immediately issue them to a specific, pre-existing workorder,
**so that** urgent jobs can be fulfilled without the delay of the standard put-away and picking process.

This process, known as "cross-docking," ensures that high-priority parts are directly routed to the point of need, increasing workshop throughput.

## Actors & Stakeholders

- **Primary Actor:**
  - **Inventory Manager:** The user responsible for physically and systemically receiving goods from suppliers.

- **System Actors:**
  - **POS System:** The system of record for inventory movements (receiving, issuing).

- **Stakeholders:**
  - **Work Execution System (Workexec):** The system that manages workorders and is the consumer of the issued parts. It needs to be notified of the fulfillment.
  - **Service Advisor:** Needs visibility into the workorder status to manage customer expectations.
  - **Mechanic / Technician:** The end user of the part who is waiting for it to begin or complete a job.

## Preconditions

1.  A valid Workorder exists in the Workexec system with at least one line item demanding a specific part.
2.  A Purchase Order for the corresponding part exists and is linked to the supplier's shipment.
3.  The Inventory Manager is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to perform receiving functions (including `ISSUE_PARTS` permission for confirmation).
4.  The system has a mechanism to associate an incoming receiving line with a specific `workorderId` and `workorderLineId`.

## Functional Behavior

1.  The Inventory Manager initiates the receiving process for an incoming supplier shipment.
2.  For a specific line item on the shipment, the user flags it for "Direct-to-Workorder" (cross-dock) receiving.
3.  The system prompts the user to link the receiving line to an existing workorder line.
4.  The system validates that the part number on the receiving line matches the part number demanded by the selected workorder line (see Business Rule #5 for mismatch handling).
5.  Upon the user confirming the received quantity, the system behavior depends on the configured policy:
    
    **Default Behavior (Manual Confirmation):**
    - The system presents a final confirmation screen: "You are about to issue 2 × P-ABC to Work Order WO-123. Confirm?"
    - The Inventory Manager with `ISSUE_PARTS` permission must explicitly confirm.
    - Upon confirmation, the system executes the inventory movements.
    
    **Optional Auto-Issue Behavior (Policy-Controlled):**
    - Auto-issue is allowed ONLY when ALL of the following conditions are met:
      - Exact SKU match to the workorder line
      - Quantity received ≤ quantity remaining on the workorder
      - No lot/serial/expiry exceptions
      - User/location policy enables auto-issue
    - Auto-issue must be clearly indicated in the UI and fully audited
    
6.  The system executes the following inventory movements as a single, atomic transaction:
    a. Creates an `INVENTORY_RECEIVE` ledger entry, increasing the quantity-on-hand. The source reference will be the supplier shipment and Purchase Order.
    b. Immediately creates an `INVENTORY_ISSUE` ledger entry for the same quantity, decreasing the quantity-on-hand. The destination reference will be the `workorderId`.
    - Both ledger entries must record `issueMode` (either `MANUAL_CONFIRM` or `AUTO_ON_RECEIPT`) and `confirmedBy` (user ID or SYSTEM).
7.  The net effect on 'available' stock for general sale is zero. The part's lifecycle is tracked from receipt to immediate issue.
8.  The system emits an asynchronous `InventoryIssuedToWorkOrder` event (topic: `inventory.issue.completed.v1`) to notify the downstream Work Execution system that the part is now physically available for the job. This is a non-blocking operation from the POS system's perspective.

## Alternate / Error Flows

- **Error: Mismatched Part Number:**
  - **Default Behavior:** If the user attempts to link a receiving line to a workorder line with a different part number, the system will block the action and display an error message: `PART_MISMATCH_WITH_WORKORDER`.
  - **Override (Exceptional):** Users with `OVERRIDE_PART_MATCH` permission may override this block by:
    - Providing an explicit reason code (e.g., `APPROVED_SUBSTITUTE`, `VENDOR_SUBSTITUTION`)
    - Selecting/confirming the substitute mapping
    - All override actions are fully audited
  - **Important:** Overrides MUST NOT auto-issue; they always require manual confirmation.
  - The workorder line must be updated to reflect the substitute (with traceability), or the issuance must be explicitly marked as a substitute against the original line.

- **Error: Closed/Cancelled Workorder:**
  - If the target workorder is no longer in an 'Open' or 'In-Progress' state, the system will prevent the linkage and inform the user.

- **Error: Notification Failure:**
  - If the notification event to the Workexec system fails to send, the action will be added to a retry queue. A critical alert will be logged for monitoring if retries are exhausted. The inventory transactions themselves are not rolled back.

## Business Rules

1.  Items received via the cross-dock process must not be made available to any other source of demand (e.g., other workorders, counter sales).
2.  The inventory ledger must clearly distinguish between a standard receipt (to stock) and a cross-dock receipt-and-issue.
3.  The cost of the received item must be correctly applied to the workorder as part of the issue transaction.
4.  This flow explicitly bypasses the standard 'put-away' process and bin location assignment. The temporary location is effectively the destination workorder/bay.
5.  **Confirmation Policy (Resolved):**
    - **Default:** Manual confirmation is required before issuing parts to a workorder.
    - **Auto-Issue:** May be enabled when all safety conditions are met (exact match, quantity valid, no exceptions, policy enabled).
    - All issue operations must record `issueMode` and `confirmedBy` for audit purposes.
6.  **Part Mismatch Policy (Resolved):**
    - **Default:** Strictly block issuance if part numbers do not match.
    - **Override:** Allowed only with `OVERRIDE_PART_MATCH` permission, explicit reason code, and full audit trail.
    - Overrides always require manual confirmation (never auto-issue).
7.  **Notification Policy (Resolved):**
    - Notifications to Workexec are asynchronous and non-blocking.
    - The authoritative record is the event published to `inventory.issue.completed.v1` topic.
    - Optional synchronous REST calls for UI feedback are best-effort and must not block the issue transaction.

## Data Requirements

- **Entity: `ReceivingLine`**
  - Must be extended to include optional nullable fields: `workorderId` and `workorderLineId`.
  
- **Entity: `InventoryLedgerEntry`**
  - Must include a `transactionType` (e.g., `CROSS_DOCK_RECEIVE`, `CROSS_DOCK_ISSUE` or use existing types with a new context field).
  - Must include a `sourceDocumentReference` to store the supplier shipment ID or PO number.
  - Must include a `destinationDocumentReference` to store the `workorderId`.
  - **New Fields (Resolved):**
    - `issueMode` (Enum: `MANUAL_CONFIRM`, `AUTO_ON_RECEIPT`)
    - `confirmedBy` (FK to User or SYSTEM identifier)
  
- **Permissions:**
  - `ISSUE_PARTS` - Required to confirm manual issuance
  - `OVERRIDE_PART_MATCH` - Required to override part mismatch validation
  
- **Configuration:**
  - User/location-level policy flag for enabling auto-issue
  - Reason codes for part substitutions (e.g., `APPROVED_SUBSTITUTE`, `VENDOR_SUBSTITUTION`)

- **Integration Event: `InventoryIssuedToWorkOrder`**
  - **Topic:** `inventory.issue.completed.v1`
  - **Event Envelope (Required):**
    - `eventId` (UUIDv7)
    - `eventType` ("InventoryIssuedToWorkOrder")
    - `schemaVersion` ("1")
    - `occurredAt` (ISO 8601 timestamp)
    - `producer` ("pos-inventory")
  - **Payload:**
    - `workOrderId` (UUIDv7)
    - `workOrderLineId` (UUIDv7)
    - `receiptId` (UUIDv7)
    - `productId` (UUIDv7)
    - `quantityIssued` (Number)
    - `uom` (String, e.g., "EA")
    - `lotId` (UUIDv7, optional)
    - `sourceLocationId` (UUIDv7)
    - `issueMode` (String: "MANUAL_CONFIRM" or "AUTO_ON_RECEIPT")
    - `reference` (Object):
      - `receivingLineId` (UUIDv7)

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Successful Full Quantity Cross-Dock with Manual Confirmation

- **Given** an open Workorder `WO-123` demands 2 units of part `P-ABC`.
- **And** a supplier shipment arrives containing 2 units of part `P-ABC`.
- **And** manual confirmation is required (default policy).
- **When** the Inventory Manager receives the 2 units and links them to `WO-123`.
- **Then** the system displays a confirmation screen: "You are about to issue 2 × P-ABC to Work Order WO-123. Confirm?"
- **When** the Inventory Manager confirms.
- **Then** the system creates one `INVENTORY_RECEIVE` ledger entry for 2 units of `P-ABC`.
- **And** the system creates one `INVENTORY_ISSUE` ledger entry for 2 units of `P-ABC` against `WO-123`.
- **And** both entries record `issueMode = MANUAL_CONFIRM` and `confirmedBy = <userId>`.
- **And** the quantity-on-hand for `P-ABC` is unchanged by the net transaction.
- **And** an `InventoryIssuedToWorkOrder` event is published to `inventory.issue.completed.v1` topic for `WO-123`.

### AC-2: Successful Partial Quantity Cross-Dock

- **Given** an open Workorder `WO-123` demands 2 units of part `P-ABC`.
- **And** a supplier shipment arrives containing 1 unit of part `P-ABC`.
- **When** the Inventory Manager receives the 1 unit and links it to `WO-123`.
- **And** confirms the issuance.
- **Then** the system records the receipt and issue of 1 unit in the inventory ledger.
- **And** the Workexec system is notified via event that 1 of 2 units has been issued to `WO-123`.

### AC-3: Auto-Issue When Policy Conditions Are Met

- **Given** an open Workorder `WO-789` demands 1 unit of part `P-XYZ`.
- **And** auto-issue policy is enabled for the user/location.
- **And** a supplier shipment arrives containing 1 unit of part `P-XYZ` (exact match, no exceptions).
- **When** the Inventory Manager receives the 1 unit and links it to `WO-789`.
- **Then** the system automatically issues the part without requiring manual confirmation.
- **And** both ledger entries record `issueMode = AUTO_ON_RECEIPT` and `confirmedBy = SYSTEM`.
- **And** the UI clearly indicates that auto-issue occurred.

### AC-4: Attempt to Link to a Closed Workorder

- **Given** a Workorder `WO-456` exists with a status of 'Closed'.
- **And** a supplier shipment arrives containing a part demanded by the original `WO-456`.
- **When** the Inventory Manager attempts to link the received part to `WO-456`.
- **Then** the system displays an error message stating, "Cannot issue parts to a closed workorder."
- **And** no inventory transactions are created.

### AC-5: Mismatched Part with Override

- **Given** an open Workorder `WO-555` demands part `P-AAA`.
- **And** a supplier shipment arrives containing part `P-BBB` (different part).
- **When** the Inventory Manager attempts to link `P-BBB` to `WO-555`.
- **Then** the system displays an error: `PART_MISMATCH_WITH_WORKORDER`.
- **When** a user with `OVERRIDE_PART_MATCH` permission selects "Override" and provides reason code `APPROVED_SUBSTITUTE`.
- **And** confirms the substitute mapping.
- **Then** the system presents the manual confirmation screen (override never auto-issues).
- **When** the user confirms.
- **Then** the system records the issue with full audit trail including the reason code and override permission.

## Audit & Observability

- **Audit Trail:** Every cross-dock operation must create an immutable audit log entry containing: `timestamp`, `userId`, `partNumber`, `quantity`, `supplierShipmentId`, `workorderId`, `issueMode`, and `confirmedBy`.
- **Metrics:** The system should expose metrics for:
  - `crossdock_operations_total` (counter, labeled by `issueMode`)
  - `crossdock_notification_failures_total` (counter)
  - `crossdock_override_total` (counter, labeled by `reasonCode`)
- **Logging:** Structured logs should be generated for the start and end of the cross-dock transaction, including the success or failure of the notification to Workexec.

## Resolved Questions

All open questions have been answered and incorporated into the story above:

1.  **Confirmation Policy (RESOLVED):** Two-step with configurable auto-issue, defaulting to manual confirmation. See Business Rule #5 and Functional Behavior step 5.
2.  **Notification Contract (RESOLVED):** Asynchronous, non-blocking event via message queue topic `inventory.issue.completed.v1`. See Business Rule #7 and Data Requirements.
3.  **Mismatched Part Handling (RESOLVED):** Strict block by default, with override allowed via `OVERRIDE_PART_MATCH` permission and reason code. See Business Rule #6 and Alternate Flows.
