# [BACKEND] [STORY] Availability: Normalize Manufacturer Inventory Feeds (Stub via Positivity)

> **Story Status:** Ready for Development  
> **Domain:** Inventory Control  
> **Clarification Issue:** #239 (Resolved)

---

## 1. Story Intent

Enable the POS system to receive and normalize manufacturer inventory availability data delivered via the Positivity integration service. This story focuses on consuming a standardized feed format, resolving manufacturer part numbers to internal product IDs, and storing normalized availability data for downstream consumption by availability query and allocation services.

**Key Objective:** Establish a reliable pipeline for manufacturer inventory data that maintains referential integrity with the internal product catalog while handling unmapped parts gracefully.

---

## 2. Actors & Stakeholders

### Primary Actors
- **Positivity Integration Service**: External service that delivers standardized manufacturer inventory feeds
- **pos-inventory Service**: Consumes and normalizes the feed data
- **pos-product Service**: Authoritative source for manufacturer part number mapping

### Stakeholders
- **Inventory Management Team**: Requires accurate manufacturer availability data
- **Operations Team**: Monitors unmapped parts and maintains part mapping
- **Shop Staff**: Depends on accurate availability for ordering decisions

---

## 3. Preconditions

1. **Manufacturer Part Map Exists**: The `pos-product` service maintains a `ManufacturerPartMap` that resolves manufacturer part numbers to internal product IDs.
   - API endpoint available: `GET /product/v1/manufacturer-part-map:resolve`
   - Batch API available: `POST /product/v1/manufacturer-part-map:resolve`
   - Map maintenance is handled by a separate story (not in scope here)

2. **Positivity Feed Available**: The Positivity integration service delivers manufacturer inventory feeds in a standardized JSON format.

3. **Target Database**: `pos-inventory` service has database schema for storing normalized availability records.

---

## 4. Functional Behavior

### 4.1 Feed Consumption

**Input**: Positivity delivers a standardized JSON feed with the following schema:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1",
  "manufacturerId": "UUIDv7",
  "asOf": "2026-01-12T00:00:00Z",
  "items": [
    {
      "manufacturerPartNumber": "string",
      "availableQty": 12,
      "uom": "EA",
      "unitPrice": { "amount": 100.00, "currency": "USD" },
      "leadTimeDays": { "min": 1, "max": 3 },
      "minOrderQty": 4,
      "packSize": 1,
      "sourceLocationCode": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Processing Steps**:
1. Receive feed from Positivity (REST pull or event stream - implementation choice)
2. Validate schema version compatibility
3. Extract manufacturerId and asOf timestamp
4. For each item in the feed:
   - Extract manufacturerPartNumber
   - Call pos-product API to resolve to internal productId
   - If mapped: prepare normalized record with productId
   - If unmapped: record in unmapped parts backlog for operations follow-up

### 4.2 Part Number Resolution

**API Call to pos-product**:
```
GET /product/v1/manufacturer-part-map:resolve?manufacturerId={manufacturerId}&manufacturerPartNumber={mpn}

Response:
{
  "productId": "UUIDv7",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

**Batch Resolution** (preferred for performance):
```
POST /product/v1/manufacturer-part-map:resolve
Body:
{
  "manufacturerId": "UUIDv7",
  "parts": [
    { "mpn": "ABC-123" },
    { "mpn": "XYZ-789" }
  ]
}

Response:
{
  "results": [
    { "mpn": "ABC-123", "productId": "...", "confidence": "HIGH" },
    { "mpn": "XYZ-789", "productId": null, "reason": "UNMAPPED" }
  ]
}
```

### 4.3 Normalized Record Storage

For successfully mapped items, store a normalized availability record:

**NormalizedAvailability Entity**:
- `id`: UUIDv7 (primary key)
- `productId`: UUIDv7 (foreign key to pos-product)
- `manufacturerId`: UUIDv7
- `manufacturerPartNumber`: string
- `availableQty`: decimal
- `uom`: string
- `unitPrice`: money (amount + currency)
- `leadTimeDaysMin`: integer
- `leadTimeDaysMax`: integer
- `minOrderQty`: integer (nullable - store if present, null otherwise)
- `packSize`: integer
- `sourceLocationCode`: string
- `asOf`: timestamp
- `receivedAt`: timestamp (system-generated)
- `schemaVersion`: string

### 4.4 Unmapped Parts Handling

For items that cannot be resolved to a productId:
- Insert into `UnmappedManufacturerParts` table/queue:
  - `manufacturerId`
  - `manufacturerPartNumber`
  - `firstSeen`: timestamp
  - `lastSeen`: timestamp
  - `occurrenceCount`: integer (increment on duplicate)
  - `status`: PENDING_REVIEW

**Note**: Operations team will use a separate tool/story to review and create mappings for unmapped parts.

---

## 5. Alternate / Error Flows

### 5.1 Invalid Schema Version
- **Trigger**: Incoming feed has unsupported schemaVersion
- **Action**: Log error, reject feed, alert operations
- **Outcome**: Feed is not processed; system remains stable

### 5.2 pos-product API Unavailable
- **Trigger**: Batch resolution API call fails or times out
- **Action**: Log error, optionally retry with exponential backoff
- **Outcome**: Feed processing is delayed; no data is partially stored

### 5.3 Partial Mapping Failure
- **Trigger**: Some items resolve successfully, others fail
- **Action**: 
  - Store successfully mapped items
  - Add unmapped items to UnmappedManufacturerParts
  - Log summary (e.g., "Processed 95/100 items, 5 unmapped")
- **Outcome**: Partial success; unmapped items tracked for follow-up

### 5.4 Duplicate Feed Delivery
- **Trigger**: Positivity re-sends the same feed (same manufacturerId + asOf)
- **Action**: Detect duplicate using upsert logic on (productId, manufacturerId, asOf)
- **Outcome**: Idempotent processing; no duplicate records created

### 5.5 Missing Optional Fields
- **Trigger**: `minOrderQty` is absent from feed item
- **Action**: Store null in database field
- **Outcome**: Record is saved; enforcement logic (out of scope) handles null gracefully

---

## 6. Business Rules

### BR-1: System of Record for Manufacturer Part Mapping
- **Authority**: `pos-product` service is the authoritative source
- **Access**: Via API only (no direct database access)
- **Scope**: Mapping maintenance is a precondition; this story consumes the map

### BR-2: Feed Format
- **Format**: Single standardized JSON format with versioned schema
- **Manufacturer-Specific Parsing**: NOT supported in pos-inventory; handled by Positivity
- **Transport**: REST pull or event stream (implementation choice)
- **Idempotency**: Required; use (manufacturerId, asOf, productId) as natural key

### BR-3: Minimum Order Quantity Handling
- **Presence**: Field may be absent in feed
- **Storage**: Store if present; otherwise store null
- **Enforcement**: Out of scope for this story (not enforced in ordering/cart logic)
- **Complex Rules**: Out of scope (tiered min orders, mixed-case constraints)

### BR-4: Unmapped Parts Policy
- **Action**: Surface for operations follow-up
- **Storage**: Optional backlog table/queue
- **Resolution**: Separate story for mapping maintenance

### BR-5: Data Freshness
- **Timestamp**: Use `asOf` from feed as authoritative time
- **Retention**: Define TTL or archival policy (implementation decision)

## 7. Data Requirements

### 7.1 Input Schema (from Positivity)

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1",
  "manufacturerId": "UUIDv7",
  "asOf": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "items": [
    {
      "manufacturerPartNumber": "string",
      "availableQty": "number (decimal)",
      "uom": "string (e.g., EA, CASE)",
      "unitPrice": {
        "amount": "number (decimal)",
        "currency": "string (ISO 4217)"
      },
      "leadTimeDays": {
        "min": "integer",
        "max": "integer"
      },
      "minOrderQty": "integer (optional)",
      "packSize": "integer",
      "sourceLocationCode": "string"

  - Items processed count
  - Items unmapped count
  - Error details (if any)
