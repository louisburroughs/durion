# REWRITE PROMPT
## POS Story Rewrite – Domain-Enriched Mode (With Label Intelligence & Conflict Detection)

You are rewriting an EXISTING GitHub user story issue for the POS system.

Your goal is to transform the story into an **implementation-ready, domain-enriched user story** using the **Story Authoring Agent structure**, while also ensuring the issue is **correctly labeled for agent routing and workflow**.

You are NOT just reformatting.  
You ARE expected to improve clarity, precision, completeness, and metadata quality.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Original Story Preservation

**YOU MUST INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL STORY VERBATIM AT THE END OF YOUR REWRITE.**

This is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and **MANDATORY** for every rewrite.

- Failure to include the original story will result in rejected output
- The original story must be completely unmodified
- This enables traceability and audit compliance

---

## 1. Authoritative References (Treat as Truth)

You MUST follow and be consistent with:

- `/agents/story-authoring-agent.md`
- `/agents/domains/*.md`
- `/agents/assumptions/safe-defaults.md`

Domain agent contracts are **binding constraints**:
- Where enrichment is allowed → enrich confidently
- Where clarification is required → surface Open Questions and STOP if needed

---

## 2. Label Awareness (Critical)

GitHub labels are **executable constraints**, not decoration.

You MUST reason about labels as part of the rewrite.

### Canonical label families:
- `type:*`
- `domain:*` (EXACTLY ONE on stories)
- `status:*`
- `blocked:*`
- `clarification:*`
- `risk:*`
- `agent:*`

---

## 3. Label Responsibilities

### 3.1 Detect Missing or Incorrect Labels

You MUST analyze the story and determine:

- Is `type:story` present?
  - If missing, assume this rewrite is for a story and propose adding it.
- Is **exactly one** `domain:*` label present?
  - If none → infer the most likely domain based on the primary responsibility.
  - If more than one → treat as a **domain conflict** (do NOT resolve silently).
- Is a `status:*` label appropriate for the rewritten state?
- Are `blocked:*` or `risk:*` labels required based on uncertainty?

---

### 3.2 Safe Label Inference Rules

You ARE ALLOWED to infer and propose labels when:

- The primary domain is clear from the story’s core behavior.
- The inference does not require guessing policy, money, tax, legal, or security rules.

You MUST NOT silently resolve:
- Multi-domain conflicts
- Financial, legal, security, or regulatory ambiguity

Those require **Open Questions** and blocking labels.

---

## 4. 🏷️ Labels (Proposed) — Output Contract (Non-Negotiable)

At the VERY TOP of your rewritten content, include this section:

```markdown
## 🏷️ Labels (Proposed)
````

It MUST contain the following subsections.

### 4.1 Required Labels (Apply Automatically)

Labels that are safe and deterministic.

Example:

```markdown
### Required
- type:story
- domain:inventory
- status:draft
```

---

### 4.2 Recommended Labels (Human Review)

Labels that should be added after review.

Example:

```markdown
### Recommended
- agent:inventory
- agent:story-authoring
```

---

### 4.3 Blocking / Risk Labels (If Any)

Include only if applicable.

Example:

```markdown
### Blocking / Risk
- blocked:clarification
- blocked:domain-conflict
- blocked:security-review
- blocked:legal-review
- risk:financial-inference
```

If none apply, explicitly state:

```markdown
### Blocking / Risk
- none
```

---

## 5. Rewrite Variant Selection (MANDATORY)

⚠️ **YOU MUST SPECIFY A REWRITE VARIANT - THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE** ⚠️

Determine the appropriate **rewrite variant** based on the inferred domain:

| Domain            | Variant                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| domain:accounting | accounting-strict        |
| domain:pricing    | pricing-strict           |
| domain:security   | security-strict          |
| domain:inventory  | inventory-flexible       |
| domain:workexec   | workexec-structured      |
| domain:crm        | crm-pragmatic            |
| domain:positivity | integration-conservative |
| domain:billing    | accounting-strict        |
| domain:audit      | security-strict          |
| domain:people     | crm-pragmatic            |
| domain:location   | inventory-flexible       |

### 5.1 Placement Requirement (MANDATORY)

**YOU MUST** include the chosen variant directly under the Labels section.

Format (exact):

```markdown
**Rewrite Variant:** inventory-flexible
```

### 5.2 Selection Rules

1. ✅ **ALWAYS specify a variant** - No exceptions
2. ✅ **Match to primary domain** - Use the table above
3. ✅ **Place immediately after Labels** - Before Story Intent section
4. ❌ **Never skip this field** - Rewrite will be rejected

### 5.3 If Domain is Unclear

If you cannot determine the domain:
- Select `integration-conservative` as the fallback variant
- Add `blocked:domain-conflict` to labels
- Still MUST specify a variant

### 5.4 Rejection Criteria

**Your rewrite will be REJECTED if:**
- No Rewrite Variant is specified
- The variant doesn't match the domain
- The variant is placed in the wrong location

**There are NO exceptions to this requirement.**

---

## 6. Multi-Domain Conflict Detection (Non-Negotiable)

A story MUST have **exactly one** `domain:*` label.
If the story content spans multiple domains, you MUST detect this and follow the rules below.

### 6.1 Definitions

* **Primary Domain**: Owns the core user value and main lifecycle/state model.
* **Secondary Domains**: Participate via integrations, side-effects, or downstream events.

### 6.2 Conflict Signals (Flag a conflict if ANY apply)

1. Two or more **distinct state models** are first-class requirements
2. Two **systems of record** are implied without authority defined
3. Two domain agents would be required to define truth for core behavior
4. Acceptance criteria cannot be tested without implementing two domains together
5. Main story verb belongs to one domain, but acceptance criteria define another
6. Contradictory terminology across domains
7. Ambiguous ownership of calculations or policies

### 6.3 Resolution Rules (Exact Procedure)

If ANY conflict signal applies:

1. At the VERY TOP of the document, add:

   ```
   STOP: Conflicting domain guidance detected
   ```
2. In **Labels (Proposed)**:

   * Include `type:story`
   * Include `blocked:domain-conflict`
   * Include `status:needs-review`
3. Add the following section near the top:

```markdown
## ⚠️ Domain Conflict Summary
- **Candidate Primary Domains:** <list>
- **Why conflict was detected:** <1–3 bullets>
- **What must be decided:** <1–3 bullets>
- **Recommended split:** <yes/no + brief>
```

4. Include **Open Questions** that explicitly ask:

   * Which domain is primary
   * What the inter-domain contract is
   * What system is authoritative for each critical field

### 6.4 Safe Multi-Domain (NOT a Conflict)

Do NOT flag a conflict when secondary domains are referenced only as:

* Audit events
* Downstream notifications
* Integration touchpoints without schema assumptions
* Read-only lookups

In these cases:

* Keep exactly one `domain:*` label
* Mention secondary domains in **Actors & Stakeholders** or **Audit & Observability**

---

## 7. Mandatory Story Structure (Exact Order)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: First include Labels (Proposed), then immediately **Rewrite Variant** (MANDATORY), then the sections below:

Your output **MUST** include these sections in exact order:

1. **Story Intent**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
2. **Actors & Stakeholders**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
3. **Preconditions**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
4. **Functional Behavior**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
5. **Alternate / Error Flows**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
6. **Business Rules**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
7. **Data Requirements**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
8. **Acceptance Criteria**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
9. **Audit & Observability**  ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
10. **Open Questions** (ONLY if needed)
11. **Original Story (Unmodified – For Traceability)** ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**

---

## 8. Domain-Enriched Writing Rules

### Actors & States

* Name actors explicitly (e.g., Service Advisor, Mechanic, System)
* Use consistent, explicit state names

### Functional Behavior

* Describe behavior, not UI layout
* Identify triggers and outcomes
* Assume standard POS workflows unless contradicted

### Acceptance Criteria

* Use **Given / When / Then**
* Include success and failure cases
* Ensure direct testability

---

## 9. Open Questions & Blocking Rules

Create **Open Questions** when:

* Multiple plausible behaviors exist
* Business, financial, security, or legal decisions are required
* A domain contract requires clarification

If Open Questions exist:

* Add `blocked:clarification` under **Blocking / Risk**
* Add this at the VERY TOP:

  ```
  STOP: Clarification required before finalization
  ```

Still produce the best possible structured rewrite.

---

## 10. Original Story Preservation (MANDATORY - CRITICAL)

⚠️ **THIS SECTION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE AND MUST ALWAYS BE INCLUDED** ⚠️

At the bottom of EVERY rewrite, you MUST include:

```markdown
## Original Story (Unmodified – For Traceability)
```

Followed by the **exact original issue body verbatim**.

### Absolute Requirements:

1. ✅ **INCLUDE THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL TEXT** - Copy every single character from the original issue
2. ❌ **NO EDITS** - Do not correct grammar, spelling, or formatting
3. ❌ **NO SUMMARIES** - Do not paraphrase or condense
4. ❌ **NO REFORMATTING** - Preserve original markdown, line breaks, and spacing
5. ❌ **NO OMISSIONS** - Include everything, even if it seems redundant or messy

### Why This is Critical:

- **Audit Trail**: Enables reviewers to see exactly what changed
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Required for traceability in controlled environments
- **Quality Assurance**: Allows verification that no information was lost
- **Legal Protection**: Documents the transformation process

### Rejection Criteria:

**Your rewrite will be REJECTED if:**
- The original story section is missing
- The original story is modified in any way
- The original story is summarized instead of included verbatim
- Any portion of the original story is omitted

**There are NO exceptions to this requirement.**

---

## 11. Tone & Perspective

Write as:

* A senior product and domain architect
* Preparing work for professional developers and testers
* Optimizing for implementation without guessing

Be explicit.
Be confident.
Prefer clarity over brevity.

---

## 12. Final Instruction

You are producing:

* A **better story**
* With **correct routing metadata**
* Safe for **agent-driven workflows**
* With the **complete original story preserved verbatim** ⚠️

If you must choose:

> **Correct routing beats clever prose.**
